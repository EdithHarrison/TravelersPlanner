# React + Vite



This is my final project for the React Hawk class. The app is called Traveler's Planner, and it is based on the react-todo template. I added my spin and version to the app, building upon my submitted assignment. I included more tables in Airtable, three additional routes, and revamped the design, content, and layout.

This app is deployed here https://travelersplanner.onrender.com/

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
